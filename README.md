# hakko_t12_stm32
The soldering iron controller built on stm32 micro controller.
AC6 - STM32 System Workbench & CubeMX software development tools have been used to bult the project.

Revision history

02/28/2021
- Fixed issues in the handle connection schematics.

04/18/2020
 - Tip activation menu available in tip selection mode by short press the encoder
 - Main menu is accessible in tip selection mode by long press the encoder
 - Two modes hardware switch supported: REED and TILT. Tilt switch algorithm updated.
 - Ambient temperature and tilt switch readings now are available on debug screen.
 - Debug mode available in about dialog by long press of encoder, no extrafirmware required.
   The internal information is shown on the display as following:
   P     T
         C      
   (i-t) A
         t,
   where
   P - is the applied power (rotate the encoder to change this value)
   T - is the IRON temperature
   C - is the current through the IRON
   A - is the ambient temperature in internal units, should be near 2048 for 25 Celsius 
   "i" means the controller assumes the IRON is connected
   "t" means the tilt switch is active (IRON is in use)
 

01/15/2020
 - Now tip activation menu is avalable in tip selection mode, you need long press the encoder
 - Debug verion is avaliable. In this firmware the internal information is shown on the display as following:
   -  P     T
   -        C      
   -  (i-t) A,
   where
   P - is the applied power (rotate the encoder to change this value)
   T - is the IRON temperature
   C - is the current through the IRON
   A - is the ambient temperature
   "i" means the controller assumes the IRON is connected
   "t" means the tilt switch is active (IRON is in use)

01/11/2020
 - The schematics changed
 - Buzzer is always on issue fixed
 - Screen saver feature implemented
 - New encoder button procedure increase the management stability
 

11/16/2019
- Fixed incorrect message processing issue.
    Now "EEPROM read error" message would be displayed in case if the controller cannot access EEPROM IC.
- Empty slot for TIP calibration data issue fixed. The slot of non-active tip can be used for newly activated tip.
    When new tip activated, the controller checks data written to EEPROM.
- If tip configuration data would not read correctly the "EEPROM write error" message would be displayed.

11/09/2019
- Tip connection issue has been fixed.
- Capacitor C8 has been removed from schematics.

11/05/2019
- New Encoder algorithm implemented, just press and hold the encoder button for long press
- EEPROM scheking procedure implemented, two error messages added
- Several issues fixed including:
  - default tip calibration data issue
  - automatic adjustment of the tip temperature depending on the ambient temperature issue
  
10/21/2019
- Fixed i2c type display initialization

10/15/2019
- Fixed incorrenct ambient temperature readings when power is on

10/10/2019
New controller version released, v2.00.
- Simplified schematic implemented
- New powering algorithm implemented
- OLED displays with SPI or I2C interface are supported
- PWM frequency decreased to 20HZ
- The project migrated to c++
- All procedures were revisited
- u8g2 library used in the project
- Previous release has been moved to v.100 folder
See detailed description on hacsters.io site

22/10 2018 (v1.00)
- Eeprom size error fixed
- New schema of saving tip data to the eeprom implemented.
- Now only active tips are placed to the eeprom. It is possible to ad new tip to the tip list.
- New calibration procedure implemented
- Minor bug fixed

01/04/2019 (v1.00)
- Tilt switch implemented
